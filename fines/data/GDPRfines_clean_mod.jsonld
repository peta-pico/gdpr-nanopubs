The NAIH concluded that the bank had failed to fulfill the data subject&#8217;s rights by not responding in due time and by failing to provide copies to the requested recordings. According to the NAIH, the CCTV recordings captured a public space relevant to all the bank&#8217;s customers, and that the bank could anonymize certain parts of the recordings if need be.</p>\n",

The NAIH determined that the data controller can\u2019t rely on the performance of the credit contract or the consent of the data subjects for the data processing since the data subjects had concluded this contract with the bank, not with the data controller. Thus, the data controller has no legal basis for the data processing.</p>\n",
