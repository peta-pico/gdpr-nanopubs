The bank failed to provide access to the CCTV recordings because they also contained data relevant to other third parties. The NAIH concluded that the bank had failed to fulfill the data subject&#8217;s rights by not responding in due time and by failing to provide copies to the requested recordings. According to the NAIH, the CCTV recordings captured a public space relevant to all the bank&#8217;s customers, and that the bank could anonymize certain parts of the recordings if need be.<\/p>\n"

Thus, the data controller has no legal basis for the data processing.<\/p>\n"
